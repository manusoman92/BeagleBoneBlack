First we need to load pre built binary

search angstrom beaglebone demo image on google

 openBeagleBoneBlack folder , there is a MLO file

partitioning of SD card

we required two partitioning


connect SD card

check the device by dmesg command most probabily sdb device should listed there

install gparted software and open the software

create partitions

FATFS-> BOOT - 2048mb -> set flag as boot

ext3 ->ROOTFS - remaining mb

/////How to share PC internet with beagle bone black///
login : debian
password: temppwd

check ifconfig
 list of internet interface are there

 etho -> PC ethrenet interface

 USB0 7 USB 1 are used to communicate over ethernet using USB0
  called ethernet over USB

the IP address for USB0 and USB1 interface are already assigned at booting time.
the sripts for that is located at /opt/scripts/boot

di ifconfig -a on host PC. you can see the USbover ethernet are enumerated and ip address are assigned as
192.168.7.1 and 192.168.6.1

do autoethernet for ubuntu 16.04 from internet option drop down

try to ping from host pc to BBB
ping 192.168.7.2 or 6.2
 try to ping from BBB to Host
ping 192.168.7.1

if we try to ping public ip address as
ping 8.8.8.8 from BBB, network unreachable warning will show
for that you have to share PC internet with BBB

first we have to edit /etc/resolv.conf
insert
nameserver 8.8.8.8
nameserver 8.8.4.4

next we have to add , the default gateway address to routing table
sudo route add default gw 192.168.7.1 usb0
sudo route add default gw 192.168.6.1 usb1

on host pc side you have to do ip table settings and ip forward settings

enable ip forwarding
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
or
sudo sh -c "echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward"


ip table seeting to share wifi internet with an interface

sudo iptables --table nat --append POSTROUTING --out-interface <wifi-interface> -j MASQUERADE
sudo iptables --append FORWARD --in-interface <ethernet-interface to share with> -j ACCEPT

find out name if wifi interfcae
for my case : wlp3s0
BBB interface : enxe415f6f6e0ae,
